[0x0000-0x001E]		;	defines the port that the device is attached to
			;	must be an even address

[0x0000-0xFF0F]		;	defines the initial Status register for the device
			;	This is where the device would be declared as an 
			;	input or output. This can also be used to create an 
			;	interrupt at time 0 if the DBA bit is set initially

[0 - sizeof(long)]	;	the time of interrupt of the device. when the system 
			;	clock is equal to this value the DEV SR will be set 
			;	to the following value. The interrupt will take 
			;	place after the current instruction is finished 
			;	executing on the CPU.

[0x0000-0xFF0F]		;	when the system clock equals the interrupt time the 
			;	devices Status Register is set to this value. to 
			;	ensure the device's interrupt is handled the DBA bit 
			;	must be set here.
